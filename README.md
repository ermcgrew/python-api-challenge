# python-api-challenge

Scenario: Prove that places closer to the equator are hotter, and locate a few places with the perfect weather for a vacation. Use OpenWeatherMap API, jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API.

Part I - WeatherPy
Create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator and plot the relationship of various weather measurements across latitudes.

Part II - VacationPy
Create a heatmap of humidities for the cities from part 1. Then, narrow down the list of cities to the places with ideal weather for a vacation. Find a hotel in each city and plot it with a marker on top of the heatmap.
